So, you want to get MongoDB running on your computer? 

Assuming you're on macOS, just follow along with this link: 
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ 

The general gist is to use Homebrew to install and run MongoDB locally.
From here, you can access the local database using "mongosh" on the terminal, which is 
just a shell that you can use to navigate about and make queries.

After installation and starting MongoDB, when you run "yarn start", initialization should automatically happen.

If you want to check if the items are added properly, using mongosh, type in: "use waterApp"
Then, you can type "db.wateractivities.find().pretty()" to see the initial items.
